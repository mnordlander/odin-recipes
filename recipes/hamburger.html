    <h2>This is the "real" burger</h2>
    <p>These cookies look just like little hamburgers.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 drops green food coloring</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon water</li>
        <li>¼ cup flaked coconut</li>
        <li>48 vanilla wafers</li>
        <li>24 chocolate covered thin mints</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine food coloring with a few drops of water. Add coconut and cover the container, shake until
            coconut is tinted. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place 1/2 of the vanilla wafers, flat side up, in an ungreased cookie sheet. Top each wafer with a
            peppermint patty. Place in the oven about 1 minute or just until chocolate begins to soften.</li>
        <li>Remove cookies from oven and sprinkle each mint with 1/2 teaspoon coconut (for lettuce). Place another
            vanilla wafer on top and press gentle. With a clean paint brush, brush the top of each hamburger with just
            enough water to moisten so that the sesame seeds will stick when sprinkled on top of each cookie. NOTE: You
            can use canned chocolate frosting in place of peppermint patty, then eliminate the baking.</li>
    </ol>
